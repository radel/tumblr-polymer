# tumblr-polymer

The name says pretty much all, I'm new to polymer and I'm learning through building something "useful".

The code is almost entirely based on yeoman generator for now, but it's working.

## first time install

- `npm install`
- `bower update`
- `gulp serve` - to build everything and try it out

## config

Please change the configuration with your tumblr url and api key in app/elements/tumblr/tumblr.html

## pull request

I *urge* you to correct my mistakes with a pull request, as I said I'm new to polymer and I don't know what I'm doing, really.
